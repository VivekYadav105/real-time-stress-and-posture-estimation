# Posture and Stress Analysis

## Overview
This project, "Posture and Stress Analysis," was developed during the 6th and 7th semesters as a minor project. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze posture, estimate stress levels, perform pose estimation, and object detection.

## Features
- **Stress Estimation**: Utilizes Inception V1 model for stress estimation based on input data.
- **Pose Estimation**: Implements Media Pose model for accurate pose estimation from images or videos.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Inception V1
- Media Pose
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/posture-and-stress-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. use the perbuilt models or train the models again with datasets. 
4. download the datasets:
